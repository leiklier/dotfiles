" the command :BundleInstall from within vim or directly invoking it from the
" command line with the following syntax:
" vim --noplugin -u vim/vundles.vim -N "+set hidden" "+syntax on" +BundleClean! +BundleInstall +qall

" dotfiles' vundles are split up by category into smaller files
" This reduces churn and makes it easier to fork. See
" ~/.vim/vundles/ to edit them:

runtime textmanipulation.vundle         " Plugins that makes manipulating text easier
