" --------------- Class outline viewer - Tagbar ---------------------
"  DESCRIPTION:
"  Tagbar is a Vim plugin that provides an easy way to browse the
"  tags of the current file and get an overview of its structure.
"  It does this by creating a sidebar that displays the ctags-generated
"  tags of the current file, ordered by their scope. This means that for
"  example methods in C++ are displayed under the class they are defined in.

" NB: Currently disabled because it causes vim to throw "tty suspended" error
" when launching vim

"Bundle "majutsushi/tagbar"
